  name:"Bhavana",
  description:"I, Bhavana, am a passionate and driven Information Science and Engineering graduate from Rao Bahadur Y Mahabaleswarappa Engineering College, Ballari, with a CGPA of 7.38. My academic journey has equipped me with strong technical skills in programming languages like C, Java, SQL, HTML, and CSS, along with a deep understanding of data structures, cybersecurity, and database management. I have hands-on experience in cybersecurity and IoT, having completed an internship at Tech Fortune Private Limited, where I developed an IoT-based system using Arduino to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, improving resource efficiency by 10%.  My project work reflects my interest in cybersecurity and innovative technology. I have conducted network traffic analysis using Wireshark to detect cybersecurity threats, performed vulnerability assessments using Nmap and Metasploit, and developed a muscle-controlled wheelchair to assist physically challenged individuals. Additionally, I have gained certifications in cybersecurity from Cisco and web development from Raise Digital, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning. I am always eager to explore new technologies and solve real-world problems, aiming to contribute meaningfully to the fields of cybersecurity and IoT. ",
